#Mission
The current mission statement for the envisioned organization could be something like:

*Our mission is to develop and support the concept of peer-to-peer learned hopeness* through the promotion of people's strengths, the identification and Commonization of existing solutions to world crises, the co-creation of such solutions when they are not known yet, and the teaching of such principles to people to they can promote them themselves.*

\* As opposed to *learned helplessness*
