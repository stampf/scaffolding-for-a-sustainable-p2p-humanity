# Manifesto for a peer-to-peer thriving world

Given that:

- The world is experiencing a **serious environmental crisis** (see COP21): *we want to promote new solutions of living on this planet that don't further exhaust our natural resources and endanger humanity;*
- Lots of **proven solutions exist** in the world (see all NGOs doing real work on the field): *we want to promote these existing solutions to where they're most needed*;
- **Politics don't do what is most needed by the people**: *we need to foster a P2P culture where people would co-design according to their needs, not someone else from perceived needs*;
- **Silo'ed science isn't adapted anymore to a world now perceived in all its complexity**: *we need transdisciplinarity and management of complexity brought by the latest research by systems thinkers*;
- **People are better moved by what they want** rather than what they want to escape: we've talked enough of problems and analyzed them sufficiently to now *turn ourselves to strength-based approaches to change and co-design that better world we're clinging to and find and promote working solutions*;

### Therefore we decide and engage ourselves in:
Using systems thinking to architect a strength-based systemic global P2P organization aimed at identifying, interconnecting, amplifying and refracting successful solutions, teaching people how to infect others with similar ideas and in the end helping humanity become the best it can be in fair, sustainable and free ways.

### What would it look like?

The organization we envision (for now) isn't like any kind of previously existing organization:
* it's an **NGO**  for it works without consideration of nation states;
* it's part of the new **sharing** economy, only without the economy part, because it crowdsources the Commons of knowledge and expertise and makes it available to where it is most needed;
* it's a **research organization** as well as it organizes investigations on how to find new solutions to problems (or leverage existing ones or use systems thinking to transpose solutions from one domain to another);
* it's a **social network** as well where problem tackling people could meet solution providing people, the whole being facilitated by systems thinkers 
  1. to prevent solutions from creating new problems as unwanted side effects (to quote Gene)
  2. to expand on existing solutions or 
  3. to help generate new solutions with the help of systems thinking.
