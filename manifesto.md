# Manifesto

*Here will be summarized a bunch of simple messages that could make up for a manifesto or something similar.*


## Given that:

- the world is experiencing a **serious environmental crisis** (see COP21): we want to act
- lots of **proven solutions exist** in the world (see all NGOs doing real work on the field): they need to be refracted onto the world
- **politics don't do what most people in need really want**: we need to foster a P2P culture
- **siloed science can't tackle a society and world now perceived in all its complexity**: we need systems thinkers to (finally) come to the rescue, with all the knowledge they've built around 1) managing complexity and 2) transdisciplinarity
- **people are better moved by what they want** rather than what they want to escape: we turn to strength-based approaches to change (AI, SF, PD)
- more **people are more clever in groups** (with proper facilitation) than alone: we will organize that global collective intelligence
- **all issues are most interconnected than ever**: we will organize that transdisciplinarity

### Therefore we decide and engage ourselves in:
Using systems thinking to architect a global P2P organization aimed at identifying, interconnecting, amplifying and refracting successful solutions, teach people how to infect others with similar ideas and in the end help humanity become the best it can be.
