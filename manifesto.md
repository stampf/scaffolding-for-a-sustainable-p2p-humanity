# Manifesto

*Here will be summarized a bunch of simple messages that could make up for a manifesto or something similar.*

- Given that: the world is doomed (see COP21): we want to act
- Given that lots of proven solutions exist in the world (see all NGOs doing real work on the field): they need to be refracted onto the world
- Given that politics don't do what most people in need really want: we need to foster a P2P culture
- Given that siloed science can't tackle a society and world now perceived in all its complexity: we need systems thinker to (finally) come to the rescue, with all the knowledge they've built around 1) managing complexity and 2) transdisciplinarity
- Given that people are better moved by what they want rather than what they want to escape: we turn to strength-based approaches to change (AI, SF, PD)
- Given that more people are more clever in groups (with proper facilitation) than alone: we will organize that global collective intelligence
- Given that all issues are most interconnected than ever: we will organize that transdisciplinarity

### Therefore we decide and engage ourselves in:
- using systems thinking to architect a global organization aimed at interconnecting successful initiatives
