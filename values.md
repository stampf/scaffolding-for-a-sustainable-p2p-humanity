#Values

We value the following:

- **Strengths**: all people are gifted with strengths which they have a right to express
- **Commons**: nature commons and knowledge commons should be free and accessible for all of humanity
- **Dialog**: co-construction and compassion work better when one listen with one's hears and not one's tongue. As such, deep listening and respectful exchange about one's respective perspective is crucial to achieving fruitful collaboration
