# How to do it? 

We propose to use the team syntegrity systemic method to allow field matter and p2p experts to interact together in the most efficient way in order to design a roadmap to allow for a full blown transition from the current world to a more if not full p2p mankind.

The road ahead might seem impossible to tackle. And indeed it will be a complex and tough work to reclaim. Yet, there are proofs that the P2P paradigm works:

* long before the term even existed, humans interacted, exchanged and co-created together. Probably more so in the past than nowadays
* current P2P initiatives do function, even if they’re still rooted in some capitalistic way of thinking.


## A roadmap for a global syntegration would look like the following:

1. Gathering interesting people to contribute to the improvement of this paper
2. Finalizing the list of the 12 topics or so to be addressed by the syntegration
3. Publicize the initiative and gather participation
4. Organize the work groups (in the original syntegration, there are 20 of them each participating in 2 topics and criticizing 2 others) around the 12 topics.
5. Finalize the roadmaps for all the topics and publish them
6. Turn the roadmaps into action as defined in them — ie, launch the initiative, the transformation of the world
7. Build the permanent United Peers structure to support the global movement


## What’s the vision? 
Our guiding vision is one where circles of people self-organize locally to tackle locally relevant issues, on the list of topics as defined above. Circles might be tied to geographically specific issues, and/or more topic related issues.

All bottom circles connect to an upper circle to coordinate actions with other similar circles in the broader geographic area and/or topic. and so forth up to a global level, somehow like the United Nations, only it would be more like “United Peers”.

How these circles exchange information might be in physical presence or through Internet use (collaborative platforms, video conferencing tools, decision making web sites, etc.) and is left to the circles to determine themselves.


## Leveraging existing initiatives 

### Commons 
When it comes to building a global scale P2P movement where peers are supported in direct interactions, knowledge exchange is paramount. The first movement toward which we think a connection is necessary is obviously that of The Commons.


##P2P Foundation 
With its history or studies and research in the P2P paradigm, the P2P Foundation cannot be excluded from such an initiative of course. We even anticipate a wide participation of its members in building the scaffoldings for the next roadmap to the P2P future.


## UN Global Goals mosaic
UN Global Goals Nothing much to say, check here: http://www.globalgoals.org/


## Labso (Laboratory of Social Technologies) 
The Labso has been created by Alexis Nicolas and Nicolas Stampf. It’s a strength-based facilitation technique to leverage the social networks of people to identify, amplify and refract their strengths onto the world. By adhering to the Open-Source movement, it strives to make facilitation techniques available to everyone. It embeds most of the ideas presented here: Complexity thinking, Strength-based Change and P2P networking and the Commons.


## Other initiatives Please add them there


## Words of Caution 

This initiative might be seen as trying to enforce some kind of power of the majority over minorities. It is not. The full range of variety of people and their corresponding perspective on the world is respected and even glorified.

This initiative is indeed a method proposal (based on sound systemic laws and proven solutions) to help people connect more one to another if they wish to do so.

How circles tackle local issues is left to their own decision, so they work out what works best for them, given the specificities of the people impacted and the context in which they live.

Should issues be unable to resolve at a specific level, they should be brought one level up for remediation. It is expected the initial syntegration will propose some governance model to resolve such issues, although for a starter, whatever model work for some local circles is deemed good.
