# Why do we propose this? 

A lot of P2P initiatives are already going on in the world, some experimenting, some already validated, well and alive.

Yet as good as these initiatives might be, most of them are disconnected one from the other, thereby losing the potential of eliciting emergence from co-creation.

This is all the most disappointing as these successful initiatives wouldn’t be what they are if not already for the power of networking between peers and, well, emergence and co-creation.

Yet emergence seems to stop at some kind of frontier, some Dunbar-like number or similar which limit the impact and participation to the solution to a small team at best (the P2P Foundation being a kind of exception given the high number of people participating, yet 1) most of them are specialized in a few fields and 2) few really build together.

On another aspect, P2P is currently used by the most “on the edge” people, the ones with an entrepreneur mindset. But what about the rest of the world? How to attract them? From a “change adoption curve” it would seem we need to “attract” new “customers”. But what if we built a P2P system that might turn any person into an Early Adopter because the system can bring him/her exactly what’s she’s looking for?

## What we propose 
What we propose is precisely to build a proto (in the sense of “ancient” or “ancestor”) P2P network whose purpose would precisely to devise a roadmap toward that sustainable AND abundance-based P2P society.

This proto would be deemed to disappear once the real P2P system start to take off and acquire autonomy.

That proto would need to (and this, indeed, is a proto-proto needs analysis) to:

* list the societal topics to be addressed by the roadmap  — Syntegrity ideally requires 12 such topics at most, though it might be possible to work with more or less.
* analyze the current systemic conditions of society and its transformation into a more P2P-practising society (that it become a P2P-only society or that P2P coexists with capitalism will have to be decided by the syntegration)
* how to grow such a P2P society from the world as it is at the time of starting the syntegration, to the state defined at the previous point (100% P2P society or only partially P2P society)
* how to make that P2P society as encompassing as possible by respecting a few conditions:


1. be accessible to anybody on planet Earth without consideration of any sort of criteria
2. be sustainable (ie, not assume an infinite world)
3. be abundance-based (ie assume everybody has something worth to contribute to the world, whatever his/her possibilities)


Also, the following needs will have to be addressed:

* how to source (fund, crowdsource…) the initiative beyond 1) this document and 2) the scaffolding stage (ie, the syntegration in itself)
* whether it is needed to sustain the syntegration over time (possibly in another form) or not at all (and let the P2P society decide this later). If something needs to be sustained over time, then our to source it will also need to be addressed.

## List of topics to be included
This list would ideally be of 12 topics. Should we end with a different number (as ideally required by Team Syntegrity), another scheme could be devised.

1. agriculture, 
* economy, 
* health, 
* technology/energy, 
* politics, 
* commons, 
* art, 
* spirituality, 
* education, 
* transport, 
* governance
