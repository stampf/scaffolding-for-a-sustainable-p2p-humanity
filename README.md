Scaffolding for a sustainable P2P humanity
=======

As explained in the [Manifesto](manifesto.md), the purpose of this paper is about leveraging systems thinking to foster a strength-based global peer-to-peer humanity where people are used to identifying, interconnecting, amplifying and refracting successful solutions in order to help humanity become the best it can be in fair, sustainable and free ways.

As  has been advocated by the [P2P Foundation](http://www.p2pfoundation.net/) since a few years, we need a change of paradigm if we're to survive:
* where a scarcity of ideas is organized for the capitalization of intelligence, we need to grow the intellectual Commons to share working solutions;
* where industrialization of production is organized with few consideration for people and the environment, we need to relocalize production to better control its environmental impact and re-knit the social fabric of local communities.

Where Systems Thinking has been successfully used mostly in business consideration for tens of years (and at least one [governmental situation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Cybersyn)), it is time to leverage that knowledge and put it to use in service of the whole humanity.

We're walking our own talk in that we know we (however great experts will participate in this initiative) can't have any definitive answer to all problems. As a consequence we think that:
1. The global organization will need to rely heavily on local initiatives and support and promote them;
2. The global organization itself will need to be co-created by people from as diverse a variety of perspectives as possible

Therefore, the current stage of this initiative being that of a proposal, we're working together to assemble the founding principles and people that will allow the best global organization to emerge. 

Consequently, this very document aimed to be a work in progress AND collaboratively constructed. Ideas proposed herein are just this: proposals, and what's legible at one time may not be n the future anymore, for a consensus toward something else might have emerged.

Let's move from a world of (not so) United Nations to a world of **United People**.
