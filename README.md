Scaffolding for a sustainable P2P humanity
=======

Preliminary note: *this document is a work in progress, far from finished. I’m writing this here because it’s the platform I can have access to that’s not filtered by the infrastructure I work through. I’ll review comments and integrate them. If you want to propose me another collaborative document editing platform, feel free (forget about *box, *drive, etherpads and the like. Unfortunately). *

You can contact me through Twitter ([@nicolastampf](http://twitter.com/nicolasstampf)) or through http://about.me/nicolas.stampf.

 **This book is a draft in progress using Gitbook. Fork and edit, then propose (pull request) your changes for integration.**

## Words of Caution 

This initiative might be seen as trying to enforce some kind of power of the majority over minorities. It is not. The full range of variety of people and their corresponding perspective on the world is respected and even glorified.

This initiative is indeed a method proposal (based on sound systemic laws and proven solutions) to help people connect more one to another if they wish to do so.

How circles tackle local issues is left to their own decision, so they work out what works best for them, given the specificities of the people impacted and the context in which they live.

Should issues be unable to resolve at a specific level, they should be brought one level up for remediation. It is expected the initial syntegration will propose some governance model to resolve such issues, although for a starter, whatever model work for some local circles is deemed good.
