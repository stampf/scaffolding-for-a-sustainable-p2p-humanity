# What is Needed Now? 

In order to advance this proposal we need contributors, depending on the phase the organization is in. 

We currently are at phase 0 of improving this document.

##Phase 0: Developing this scaffolding proposal

During this early phase of development, we want contributors to this scaffolding document, aimed to be mostly a call to good wills.

Specific 
* Systems Thinkers to further refine the systemic aspects of this proposal or clarify it;
* Field workers in NGOs or local associations to challenge our thinking and improve the proposal on how an organization like the one we envision could help contribute and deliver its value;
* P2P and Commons researchers to inform this proposal about that aspect and how to connect Commons and those in need.

* Graphists to
* contributors to evolve it and help it move from wish list to action plan (use the comment feature of Medium) on the right, or propose bigger editions as answers (replies below).

##Phase 1: Defining the organization

##Phase 2: Launching the organization

##Phase 3: Participating in the organization

/**
* for later: awake all subject matter experts (SME) who could potentially contribute to the building of the roadmap to a sustainable, abundance-based P2P society (ie, contribute durin the scaffolding moments)
* list of online platforms where Syntegration could happen (most probably each vertex will be whole teams scattered throughout the planet), although using simple tools might be possible too
