# First Chapter


Why do we propose this? 

A lot of P2P initiatives are already going on in the world, some experimenting, some already validated, well and alive.

Yet as good as these initiatives might be, most of them are disconnected one from the other, thereby losing the potential of eliciting emergence from co-creation.

This is all the most disappointing as these successful initiatives wouldn’t be what they are if not already for the power of networking between peers and, well, emergence and co-creation.

Yet emergence seems to stop at some kind of frontier, some Dunbar-like number or similar which limit the impact and participation to the solution to a small team at best (the P2P Foundation being a kind of exception given the high number of people participating, yet 1) most of them are specialized in a few fields and 2) few really build together.

On another aspect, P2P is currently used by the most “on the edge” people, the ones with an entrepreneur mindset. But what about the rest of the world? How to attract them? From a “change adoption curve” it would seem we need to “attract” new “customers”. But what if we built a P2P system that might turn any person into an Early Adopter because the system can bring him/her exactly what’s she’s looking for?

What we propose What we propose is precisely to build a proto (in the sense of “ancient” or “ancestor”) P2P network whose purpose would precisely to devise a roadmap toward that sustainable AND abundance-based P2P society.

This proto would be deemed to disappear once the real P2P system start to take off and acquire autonomy.

That proto would need to (and this, indeed, is a proto-proto needs analysis) to:

list the societal topics to be addressed by the roadmap (agriculture, economy, health, technology/energy, politics, commons, art, spirituality, education, transport, governance…) — Syntegrity ideally requires 12 such topics at most, though it might be possible to work with more or less.
analyze the current systemic conditions of society and its transformation into a more P2P-practising society (that it become a P2P-only society or that P2P coexists with capitalism will have to be decided by the syntegration)
how to grow such a P2P society from the world as it is at the time of starting the syntegration, to the state defined at the previous point (100% P2P society or only partially P2P society)
how to make that P2P society as encompassing as possible by respecting a few conditions:

be accessible to anybody on planet Earth without consideration of any sort of criteria
be sustainable (ie, not assume an infinite world)
be abundance-based (ie assume everybody has something worth to contribute to the world, whatever his/her possibilities)

Also, the following needs will have to be addressed:

how to source (fund, crowdsource…) the initiative beyond 1) this document and 2) the scaffolding stage (ie, the syntegration in itself)
whether it is needed to sustain the syntegration over time (possibly in another form) or not at all (and let the P2P society decide this later). If something needs to be sustained over time, then our to source it will also need to be addressed.

How to do it? We propose to use the team syntegrity systemic method to allow field matter and p2p experts to interact together in the most efficient way in order to design a roadmap to allow for a full blown transition from the current world to a more if not full p2p mankind.

The road ahead might seem impossible to tackle. And indeed it will be a complex and tough work to reclaim. Yet, there are proofs that the P2P paradigm works:

long before the term even existed, humans interacted, exchanged and co-created together. Probably more so in the past than nowadays
current P2P initiatives do function, even if they’re still rooted in some capitalistic way of thinking.

A roadmap for a global syntegration would look like the following:

Gathering interesting people to contribute to the improvement of this paper
Finalizing the list of the 12 topics or so to be addressed by the syntegration
Publicize the initiative and gather participation
Organize the work groups (in the original syntegration, there are 20 of them each participating in 2 topics and criticizing 2 others) around the 12 topics.
Finalize the roadmaps for all the topics and publish them
Turn the roadmaps into action as defined in them — ie, launch the initiative, the transformation of the world
Build the permanent United Peers structure to support the global movement

What’s the vision? Our guiding vision is one where circles of people self-organize locally to tackle locally relevant issues, on the list of topics as defined above. Circles might be tied to geographically specific issues, and/or more topic related issues.

All bottom circles connect to an upper circle to coordinate actions with other similar circles in the broader geographic area and/or topic. and so forth up to a global level, somehow like the United Nations, only it would be more like “United Peers”.

How these circles exchange information might be in physical presence or through Internet use (collaborative platforms, video conferencing tools, decision making web sites, etc.) and is left to the circles to determine themselves.

Leveraging existing initiatives Commons When it comes to building a global scale P2P movement where peers are supported in direct interactions, knowledge exchange is paramount. The first movement toward which we think a connection is necessary is obviously that of The Commons.

P2P Foundation With its history or studies and research in the P2P paradigm, the P2P Foundation cannot be excluded from such an initiative of course. We even anticipate a wide participation of its members in building the scaffoldings for the next roadmap to the P2P future.







UN Global Goals mosaicUN Global Goals Nothing much to say, check here: http://www.globalgoals.org/

Labso (Laboratory of Social Technologies) The Labso has been created by Alexis Nicolas and Nicolas Stampf. It’s a strength-based facilitation technique to leverage the social networks of people to identify, amplify and refract their strengths onto the world. By adhering to the Open-Source movement, it strives to make facilitation techniques available to everyone. It embeds most of the ideas presented here: Complexity thinking, Strength-based Change and P2P networking and the Commons.

Other initiatives Please add them there

Words of Caution This initiative might be seen as trying to enforce some kind of power of the majority over minorities. It is not. The full range of variety of people and their corresponding perspective on the world is respected and even glorified.

This initiative is indeed a method proposal (based on sound systemic laws and proven solutions) to help people connect more one to another if they wish to do so.

How circles tackle local issues is left to their own decision, so they work out what works best for them, given the specificities of the people impacted and the context in which they live.

Should issues be unable to resolve at a specific level, they should be brought one level up for remediation. It is expected the initial syntegration will propose some governance model to resolve such issues, although for a starter, whatever model work for some local circles is deemed good.

What is Needed Now? In order to advance this proposal we need:

contributors to evolve it and help it move from wish list to action plan (use the comment feature of Medium) on the right, or propose bigger editions as answers (replies below).
for later: awake all subject matter experts (SME) who could potentially contribute to the building of the roadmap to a sustainable, abundance-based P2P society (ie, contribute durin the scaffolding moments)
list of online platforms where Syntegration could happen (most probably each vertex will be whole teams scattered throughout the planet), although using simple tools might be possible too

Our building blocks Systems thinking: the more expertise the better Perspective on an issue. This also is consistent with Complexity thinking.
Team syntegrity (from Stafford Beer), based on the work from Buckminster Fuller, the most efficient way of integrating perspective of multiple persons on multiple topics
Strength-based approaches to change (Solution Focus, Appreciative Inquiry, Positive Deviance)
P2p paradigm itself: a few can’t design for the rest of the world (and it’d be violating systemic law of Ross Ashby. Requisite variety)
Sociocracy as an example of governance organized around 3 values of Equivalence, Focus and Transparency
