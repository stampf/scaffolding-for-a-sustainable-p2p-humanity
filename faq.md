# FAQ

Here are some answers to the most common questions asked about this initiative.

* **Does this initiative wants to solve all problems of the world?**
  
  Absolutely not. It wants to help connect proven solutions with problems customers of the organization will bring to its attention. Should a solution not be available, it will propose means of working (using systems thinking methods and principles) to help develop a working solution.

* **Is this related to Paris attacks?**

  Absolutely not, though it msut be confessed that our determination have probably been encouraged by them.
  
* **What about the United Nations (UN)? Are you in competition with them?**
  
  Good question. The UN have been (and continues) a great active support in favor of peace throughout the world. Unfortunately, it does not seem to be in his perimeter to intervene *before* problems arise. That would have been the field of religions to do so, only if some of them haven't turned to extremisms. We now feel that it's time for a lay version of brotherhood and connectedness among people of Earth.

  The UN will continue to bring peace and globally intervene between the Nations, when these are failing.
  
  We just think there is room for better direct person to person interconnectedness.
