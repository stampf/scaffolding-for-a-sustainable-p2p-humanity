# FAQ

Here are some answers to the most common questions asked about this initiative.

* **Does this initiative wants to solve all problems of the world?**
  
  Absolutely not. It wants to help connect proven solutions with problems customers of the organization will bring to its attention. Should a solution not be available, it will propose means of working (using systems thinking methods and principles) to help develop a working solution.

* **Is this related to Paris attacks?**

  Absolutely not, though it msut be confessed that our determination have probably been encouraged by them.
  
* **What about the United Nations (UN)? Are you in competition with them?**
  
  Good question. The UN have been (and continues) a great active support in favor of peace throughout the world. Unfortunately, it does not seem to be in his perimeter to intervene *before* problems arise. That would have been the field of religions to do so, only if some of them haven't turned to extremisms. We now feel that it's time for a lay version of brotherhood and connectedness among people of Earth.

  The UN will continue to bring peace and globally intervene between the Nations, when these are failing.
  
  We just think there is room for better direct person to person interconnectedness.

* **Is is going to be a World Government?**
  Absolutely not. We want to raise people's capacity to self-organize and support one another, not direct their lives. Systems Thinking tells us that resilience emerges out of diversity. That's how Nature thrives, and how humanity passed through various crisis during its history: unexpected ideas came out of unexpected places as well as planned researched. We want not only to preserve that, but activate it as well.

  We want to move away from too much uniformity and toward more diversity, while finding the subtle balance between efficiency and adaptation.
  
* **The pre-industrial age was mostly P2P. Why would it work now when it didn't then?**
  That's true, when people could only exchange with their neighbors, social bonds were fewer but stronger. Unsustainable practices where quickly spotted and Commons Governance put in place. Industrialization unfortunately changed that and we could think it was for the worse, and that everything started to slip down ever since.

  Although it is true that industrialization brought a hell lot of negative impacts on natural health, agriculture and [the climate](http://climate.nasa.gov/), the most modern ages also brought us global communication which allows us to 1) discover the huge diaspora of humanity 2) go help people in need and 3) exchange information.
  
  We want to leverage this global community by tightening it and turning it into the tremendous encouraging power social networks can have on people, in service of the best of all.
