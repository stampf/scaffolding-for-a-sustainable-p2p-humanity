# Forewords

This document is a work in progress whose content will be updated by the first people to work on it. It's both the initial driving intent and the result of our thinking together.

This document is a draft in progress using [Gitbook](http://www.gitbook.com/). Fork and edit, then propose (pull request) your changes for integration (you can do that at [this Github URL](https://github.com/stampf/scaffolding-for-a-sustainable-p2p-humanity)).

This initiative might be seen as trying to enforce some kind of power of the majority over minorities. It is not. The full range of variety of people and their corresponding perspective on the world is respected and even glorified. 

**This initiative is indeed an invitation to attend and foster more of the creativity and generosity people most often demonstrate when they interact freely one with another.**
